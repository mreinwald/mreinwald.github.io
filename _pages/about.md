I’m a tenure track assistant professor of Management at University of Mannheim in Germany.

My research interests focus on organizational behavior in teams and organizations, specically how diversity, responsible leadership, and organizational change efforts shape social dynamics and, ultimately,organizational performance. My research has been published in the *Academy of Management Journal*, *Journal of Applied Psychology*, *Journal of Management*, *Journal of Organizational Behavior*, and *Human Resource Management*, among others. Related work has been featured on a range of news outlets including MarketWatch, Morningstar, ZEIT, and Handelsblatt. For my research, I received national and international awards, such as the Schmalenbach-Preis 2020 for the best dissertation in business administration and Best Paper Awards from the Academy of Management’s DEI and OB divisions.

I teach Corporate Social Responsibility, Leadership, Teamwork, and Change Management at the Bachelor and Master level and act as advisor for these students’ theses.
