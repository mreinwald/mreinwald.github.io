I’m an assistant professor at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.en.ilo.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html'>Institute for Leadership and Organization</a> at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich in Germany.

In my research, I study inclusion and collaboration in teams and organizations, with a special focus on how (1) diversity, (2) organizational change, and (3) digital technologies influence collaborations and inclusiveness. My research has been published in the *Academy of Management Journal*, *Journal of Management*, *Journal of Organizational Behavior*, and the *Best Paper Proceedings of the Academy of Management*, among others. Related work has been featured on a range of news outlets including MarketWatch, Morningstar, ZEIT, and Handelsblatt. For my research, I received national and international awards, such as the Schmalenbach-Preis 2020 for the best dissertation in business administration and Best Paper Awards from the Academy of Management’s GDO and OB divisions.

I teach Leadership, Teamwork, and Human Resource Management at the Bachelor and Master level and act as advisor for these students’ theses.

I enjoy time outdoors ski touring, hiking, and running. This webpage is an ongoing project. Thus, do check back from time to time as this page grows and expands. Thanks.
