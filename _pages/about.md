I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Cluster of Excellence <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/'>“The Politics of Inequality”</a> and at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/kunze/'>Group for Organizational Studies</a> at University of Konstanz in Germany.


My research includes diversity, human resource management practices, and leadership. As demographic diversity grows and more businesses struggle to reap the benefits of diversity and avoid negative consequences, the main focus of my work has become inclusion in organizational contexts and how organizations and leaders can together successfully deal  with ongoing diversity challenges. I rely on quantitative methods and study effects of diversity dynamically on multiple levels over time.


My research is published in the *Academy of Management Journal*, the *Journal of Organizational Behavior*, and the *Best Paper Proceedings of the Academy of Management*. Related work has been featured on a range of news outlets including MarketWatch, Morningstar, ZEIT, and Handelsblatt. For my research I received the 2018 Best Student Paper Award and the 2018 Outstanding Reviewer Award by the Gender and Diversity Division of the Academy of Management, I was shortlisted for the VHB Best Paper Award 2020, and also received fellowships from the Graduate School of Decision Sciences and the Zukunftskolleg.

When disseminating my research insights, I actively cooperate with organizations and publish in practitioner-oriented publications. I am particularly interested in the start-up scene and occasionally enjoy participating in a <a style='color: black;' href="/files/AnnualReportGSDS_Kilometer1.pdf">start-up competition</a>.


At the University of Konstanz, I teach Human Resource Management and Teamwork at the undergraduate level and act as advisor for these students’ theses. Here is <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/kunze/team/research-associates/research-associates/max-reinwald/'>my homepage</a> at University of Konstanz.


I enjoy time outdoors ski touring, hiking, and running. This webpage is currently an ongoing project, so bear with me, as not all links are up and running fully yet. Thus, do check back from time to time as this page grows and expands. Thanks.
