I'm a doctoral candidate in organizational behavior at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.gsds.uni-konstanz.de/'>Graduate School of Decision Sciences</a>, research associate at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/kunze/'>Group for Organizational Studies</a>, and Fellow at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.uni-konstanz.de/zukunftskolleg/'>Zukunftskolleg</a> at the University of Konstanz, Germany.


My research revolves around diversity, leadership, and organizational climate. As demographic diversity grows and businesses struggle with reaping the benefits of diversity and avoiding negative consequences a main focus of my work is diversity and inclusion in organizational contexts and how organizations and leaders can deal with diversity challenges. I rely on quantitative methods and study effects dynamically over time and on multiple levels. 


My research has been published in outlets such as the *Journal of Organizational Behavior* and the *Academy of Management Best Paper Proceedings* and has been featured in news outlets. I act as reviewer for journals such as the *Journal of Organizational Behavior* and the *European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology*. For my work I have received the 2018 Best Student Paper Award and the 2018 Outstanding Reviewer Award by the Gender and Diversity Division of the Academy of Management and fellowships from the Graduate School of Decision Sciences and the Zukunftskolleg. 


In disseminating my research insights I actively cooperate with organizations and publish in practitioner-oriented publications. Moreover, I'm interested in the startup scene and occasionally I end up as participant in a <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/university/news-and-media/current-announcements/news/news-in-detail/Auf-ins-Silicon-Valley/'>startup idea competition</a>. 


At University of Konstanz I teach undergraduates on Human Resource Management and Teamwork and act as advisor for their theses. Here is <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/kunze/team/research-associates/research-associates/max-reinwald/'>my homepage</a> at University of Konstanz.


When I'm not working I enjoy my time outdoors with ski touring, hiking, and running. And when there is still time left I try building and maintaining this webpage but please bear with me that not all parts of the webpage are up and running at the moment so check back from time to time.
