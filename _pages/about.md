I’m an assistant professor at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.en.ilo.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html'>Institute for Leadership and Organization</a> at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich in Germany.


My research includes diversity, human resource management practices, and leadership. As demographic diversity grows and more businesses struggle to reap the benefits of diversity and avoid negative consequences, the main focus of my work has become inclusion in organizational contexts and how organizations and leaders can together successfully deal  with ongoing diversity challenges. I rely on quantitative methods and study effects of diversity dynamically on multiple levels over time.


My research has been published in the *Academy of Management Journal*, *Journal of Management*, *Journal of Organizational Behavior*, and the *Best Paper Proceedings of the Academy of Management*, among others. Related work has been featured on a range of news outlets including MarketWatch, Morningstar, ZEIT, and Handelsblatt. For my research I received the 2018 Best Student Paper Award and the Outstanding Reviewer Awards by the Gender and Diversity Division of the Academy of Management (2018, 2020), the Schmalenbach-Preis 2020 for the best dissertation in business administration, and I was shortlisted for the VHB Best Paper Award 2020. 

When disseminating my research insights, I actively cooperate with organizations and publish in practitioner-oriented publications. I am particularly interested in the start-up scene and occasionally enjoy participating in a <a style='color: black;' href="/files/AnnualReportGSDS_Kilometer1.pdf">start-up competition</a>.


I teach Leadership, Teamwork, and Human Resource Management at the Bachelor and Master level and act as advisor for these students’ theses.

I enjoy time outdoors ski touring, hiking, and running. This webpage is currently an ongoing project, so bear with me, as not all links are up and running fully yet. Thus, do check back from time to time as this page grows and expands. Thanks.
