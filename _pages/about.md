I’m an assistant professor at the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.en.ilo.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/index.html'>Institute for Leadership and Organization</a> at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich in Germany.

In my research, I study inclusion and collaboration in teams and organizations, with a special focus on how (1) diversity, (2) leadership, and (3) digital technologies influence collaborations and inclusiveness. 

My research has been published in the *Academy of Management Journal*, *Journal of Management*, *Journal of Organizational Behavior*, and the *Best Paper Proceedings of the Academy of Management*, among others. Related work has been featured on a range of news outlets including MarketWatch, Morningstar, ZEIT, and Handelsblatt. For my research I received national and international awards, such as the Best Paper with International Implications Award from the Organizational Behavior division at the Academy of Management annual conference 2022, the Best Student Paper Award 2018 and the Outstanding Reviewer Awards by the Gender and Diversity Division of the Academy of Management (2018, 2020), and the Schmalenbach-Preis 2020 for the best dissertation in business administration. 

I teach Leadership, Teamwork, and Human Resource Management at the Bachelor and Master level and act as advisor for these students’ theses.

I enjoy time outdoors ski touring, hiking, and running. This webpage is currently an ongoing project, so bear with me, as not all links are up and running fully yet. Thus, do check back from time to time as this page grows and expands. Thanks.
