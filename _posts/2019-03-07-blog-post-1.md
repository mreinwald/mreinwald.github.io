My own webpage is now up and running. I spent my last evenings building this webpage using github pages and markdown. Actually it was great fun as the Jekyll theme "academic pages" I used as a template was very much what I was looking for in terms of minimalistic design with all relevant information in place. So have a look at my page and let me know how you like it.
